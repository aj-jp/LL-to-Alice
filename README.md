# Love Letters to Alice

A vulnerable Ubuntu machine built for a CTF Hackathon, of medium difficulty for beginner cybersecurity students. The web puzzles and attack pathway are all designed to draw attention to common beginner blindspots. The root flag cannot be obtained without having first received all of the other flags. I like to call this a "kick-yourself" box, and I've been told the mood is quite trippy. Some reviews from my colleagues:

"____ __ are you $h!++!n me" - an Instructional Associate

"i hate you" - that same Instructional Associate

"ok, ok, you got me *frustrated sigh*..... ok yeah, that was cute" - a Senior Instructor

"the only reason you think this is easy is because YOU built it" - a different Senior Instructor

"that was wild" - a student

"Q from a student: were you on drugs when you made the box?" - the Head Instructor


To which my responses are, respectively: "Yes.", "Yes.", "from you? I'll take it!", "hahahaha!", *virtual fist-bump*, and "You tell that student that *flips hair* I don't need drugs."


Possibly in review for hosting on Vulnhub with significant changes. At present the OVA file, as well as a walkthrough and list of flags/clues, is available to view open request.
