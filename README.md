# Love Letters to Alice

A vulnerable Ubuntu machine built for a CTF Hackathon, intentionally designed to be of medium difficulty for beginner cybersecurity students. Half of the flags are hidden past web puzzles designed to draw attention to common beginner blindspots. I like to call this a "kick-yourself" box, and I've been told the mood is quite trippy. Some reviews from my colleagues at FSA:

"____ __ are you $h!++!n me

....i hate you" - Instructional Associate

"ok, ok, you got me *frustrated sigh*..... ok yeah, that was cute" - Senior Instructor

"the only reason you think this is easy is because YOU built it" - Senior Instructor

"that was wild" - student

"Q from a student: were you on drugs when you made the box?" - Head Instructor

To which my responses are "Yes.", "from you? I'll take it!", "hahahaha!", *virtual fist-bump*, and "You tell that student that *flips hair* I don't need drugs."


Possibly in review for hosting on Vulnhub with significant changes. At present the OVA file, as well as a walkthrough and list of flags/clues, is available to view open request.
